"""
    ReadUserVars(freestream::NamedTuple, dx::Union{Missing,Float64}, dt::Union{Missing,Float64}, Re::Float64, T::Union{Missing,Float64})

This function processes input parameters and returns computed values for `dx`, `freestream`, `dt`, and `T`.

# Arguments
- `freestream::NamedTuple`: A named tuple containing the freestream values (`Ux`, `Uy`, `inclination`).
- `dx::Union{Missing, Float64}`: Spatial step size, which may be provided or missing.
- `dt::Union{Missing, Float64}`: Time step size, which may be provided or missing.
- `Re::Float64`: Reynolds number.
- `T::Union{Missing, Float64}`: Final simulation time, which may be provided or missing.

# Returns
- `dx::Float64`: Computed or provided spatial step size.
- `freestream::NamedTuple`: Updated freestream named tuple containing functions for `Ux`, `Uy`, and `inclination`.
- `dt::Float64`: Computed or provided time step size.
- `T::Float64`: Computed or provided final simulation time.

# Details
1. The function checks if `Ux`, `Uy`, and `inclination` are present in the `freestream` named tuple.
    - If not, defaults to constant values (1.0 for `Ux`, 0.0 for `Uy` and `inclination`).
2. Sets `dx` to `2.0/Re` if `dx` is missing.
3. Computes `dt` based on the maximum velocity in `freestream` if `dt` is missing.
    - If `T` is provided, uses it for the computation of `Umax`.
    - If `T` is missing, sets `T` to `20.0 * dt`.

        ty -> 0.0*ty^0.0 ==> Does not work when trying to extract Uy from freestream.
        I believe that this is due the fact that implicit functions cannot be zero out (t -> t*0.0 ==> WRONG).
